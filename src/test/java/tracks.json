To put this feeling into music I have to lock myself in the studio, immerse myself in that feeling and go explore the bleeding edges of it. It's messy: I cry, laugh, dance, go a little crazy. When I appear every now and then to go to the bathroom or make tea (I tend not to eat when I'm in this state) I probably look a little wild eyed and disturbed. This state is precious and fleeting, so I try to avoid email or talking to anyone so as not to break my bubble and lose it.\r\n\r\nBefore our son was born it was relatively easy. I could turn off email without my world falling apart too much and my husband would leave me alone, knowing that I'd be fun again in a couple days. But nowadays emails increasingly demand to be answered and how can I ignore my son when he sees me, yells \"Mama!\" and runs into my arms?! So I have to do my best to efficiently work through whatever I'm experiencing in order to be normal again in time for the family dinner. \r\n\r\nAnyway, on Wednesday I had the feeling and I acted on it. This one is vaguely about standing on the top of a mountain and being irresistibly drawn towards the edge. What if I leap? Will I fly? Will I fall? Will someone catch me?\r\n\r\nIt's not done, but I want to share it anyway. I don't normally like to play music for people before it's finished because to me those tiny endless details that take weeks to polish are what take a piece of music from ordinary to special. That said, there is always something compelling about my rough first pass, when I'm just feeling it and not worrying about technique or sound mix or how it will be perceived. I think that's one of the reasons why I love performing so much, because I get to feel each piece of music anew every night. So before I flesh this one out, polish it, turn it into something album-worthy and give it a proper title, here is the last 48 hrs in musical form.","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"recording","key_signature":"","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":118.0,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"wav","license":"all-rights-reserved","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/92681974","user":{"id":1484393,"kind":"user","permalink":"zoekeating","username":"zoekeating","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/users/1484393","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/zoekeating","avatar_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000057322597-wbe6qu-large.jpg?b09b136"},"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/zoekeating/leap-rough","artwork_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000048295827-snbz7x-large.jpg?b09b136","waveform_url":"http://w1.sndcdn.com/YVx0HDWzGBZj_m.png","stream_url":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/92681974/stream","download_url":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/92681974/download","playback_count":7471,"download_count":218,"favoritings_count":155,"comment_count":26,"attachments_uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/92681974/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":89557009,"created_at":"2013/04/26 07:24:25 +0000","user_id":1484393,"duration":186348,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":32859672,"sharing":"public","tag_list":"cello ableton","permalink":"star-spangled-banner","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":true,"purchase_url":null,"label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Patriotic American Songs","title":"Star Spangled Banner","description":"I know, you're thinking....why is Zoe posting a recording of the Star Spangled Banner???\r\n\r\nWell, I was invited to perform the national anthem at a GRAMMY awards ceremony in Washington DC.  I have a difficult relationship with patriotic songs. Maybe it started when my family moved to America when I was 10 and I didn\u2019t want to go, but in high school I stubbornly refused to sing the anthem and opted out of the Pledge of Allegiance. So first, I tried playing it straight, in a variety of key signatures. This was unsatisfying. The music just didn\u2019t mean anything to me and I couldn\u2019t muster up the necessary amount of cheese and bombast to pull it off. It\u2019s that kind of piece: major key, essentially a hymn. Maybe I wasn\u2019t patriotic enough to play this thing? Then there are the words. Boy, did I pore over those words. How to match the music with the meaning of the words? Eventually I tired of playing the melody (everyone in the house was tired of it too) and I started improvising. But when I focused on rendering those words into notes, I ended up with horror movie music. I decided to give it a rest for a week and work on my own damn music, which arguably is what I should be doing anyway.\r\n\r\nOver the weekend I thought maybe I should educate myself in how other people had rendered this vexing song. I fired up Youtube and watched Jimmy Hendrix, Whitney Houston, Alicia Keys, Nirvana (theirs was my favorite actually\u2026a staggering Kurt Cobain plays the anthem while the rest of the band trashes all their gear). Watching the endless variations I came to the realization that the most patriotic way to play the Star Spangled Banner is to make up your own damn version. Only in America can you remake the national anthem to fit YOU. That was the permission I needed. I spent a day (the horrible day after the horrible Boston Marathon) working out a looped and layered version of the Star Spangled Banner.\r\n\r\nThe result is rough around the edges, has moments of hopeful exuberance, doubt and a little bit cheese in the middle. Just like me. Just like America.\r\n\r\nWe have our issues, but this is a great place to be.\r\n\r\n(p.s. this is essentially a live recording and isn\u2019t mastered or anything proper like that, so listen at your own risk.)","label_name":"","release":"","track_type":"recording","key_signature":"G","isrc":"","video_url":null,"bpm":86.0,"release_year":null,"release_month":null,"release_day":null,"original_format":"wav","license":"cc-by-nc-sa","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/89557009","user":{"id":1484393,"kind":"user","permalink":"zoekeating","username":"zoekeating","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/users/1484393","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/zoekeating","avatar_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000057322597-wbe6qu-large.jpg?b09b136"},"permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/zoekeating/star-spangled-banner","artwork_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000046478439-a4uvkf-large.jpg?b09b136","waveform_url":"http://w1.sndcdn.com/WzXFyILZkdvG_m.png","stream_url":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/89557009/stream","download_url":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/89557009/download","playback_count":8137,"download_count":371,"favoritings_count":117,"comment_count":30,"attachments_uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/89557009/attachments"},{"kind":"track","id":68717851,"created_at":"2012/11/25 00:23:21 +0000","user_id":1484393,"duration":278333,"commentable":true,"state":"finished","original_content_size":152639824,"sharing":"public","tag_list":"darkwave","permalink":"tango","streamable":true,"embeddable_by":"all","downloadable":false,"purchase_url":"http://music.zoekeating.com/track/tango","label_id":null,"purchase_title":null,"genre":"Alternative","title":"Tango, by Zoe Keating \u0026 Jane Woodman","description":"A collaboration between Jane Woodman and Zoe Keating\r\n\r\nZo\u00eb Keating and Jane Woodman first met in 1996 when Zo\u00eb answered a listing in the San Francisco Bay Guardian for \"moody, darkwave band seeking strings\". Jane was already well known as the founder of major label band \"Van Gogh's Daughter\", whose video debut had regular rotation on MTV2. Zo\u00eb had recently arrived in San Francisco and had never before amplified her cello. Thus, along with bassist Gianfranco Pescetti, violinist Tony Cross and drummer Kat Zumbach, the band \"Alfred\" was formed. \r\n\r\nWith its lush, distorted guitars and sweeping strings, \"Alfred\" quickly gained fans and momentum. But just as they were getting started, the band broke up.
